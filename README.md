***Robotic-Assembly-using-Camera-and-Force-Torque-sensor***

This Project used many packages and dependencies. We refered and used other github repos to implement the task.
here the Link:
For UR5 packages: https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot
For other packeges or code: https://github.com/LearnRoboticsWROS/

**script**
sim.py is python script for implementing force/torque sensor to get the real time feedback and adjust the object.[in progess]
ur5_pick_place_yt.cpp is a cpp script is use to implement the pick and place task using ur5 robot.  

**Next step**
Followed the bellow github to execute the camera integration and pick up task
https://github.com/pietrolechthaler/UR5-Pick-and-Place-Simulation

We move to ROS2 to implement the task used the below github:
